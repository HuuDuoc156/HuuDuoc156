## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

About me, things I love:

Robotics: Although I wanted to become a robotic engineer for a long time, my journey with robotics started in 2024. It is fun, and there are so many things to learn
Insect-Computer Biohybrid System: This is my specialty before moving to robotics with a Ph.D. attained in 2022. I am still proactively involved in this field.
General Programming: I like to code. I am still learning to expand my coding ability, from Matlab and Embedded C (which I used in my Ph.D.) to C++ and Python, which are common in the field of robotics.
