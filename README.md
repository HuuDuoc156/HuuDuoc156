## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

A little bit about me and things that I love.

  - **Robotics**: Although I wanted to become a robotic engineer for a long time, my journey with robotics started in 2024. It is fun, and there are so many things to learn
  - **Insect-Computer Biohybrid System**: This was my specialty before I moved to robotics and attained a Ph.D. in 2022. I am still proactively involved in this field.
  - **General Programming: I like to code**: I am still learning to expand my coding ability, from Matlab and Embedded C (which I used in my Ph.D.) to C++ and Python, which are common in the field of robotics.
